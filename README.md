# Restaurant Branch Management

## About the Project
We are interested in creating an inventory-related database management system and we chose the food industry. 
This projects aims to create a database for the management of multiple restaurant branches. 
The database will track various aspects of restaurant operations including reservations, employee management, 
a list of menus offered at each branch and its associated ingredients, the customer's loyalty and subscription.  

## GUI Guide
Due to time constraint, we decided to only implement some model: branch, menu, and reservation. 
We have a table on the left and several buttons on the right with the following functionality:
1. Selection: users can choose which table they want to see
2. Insert: users can insert values to attributes of the table they choose
3. Update: users can select row and update the attributes of the table
4. Delete: users can select row and delete the row
5. Projection: users can choose which attributes to show in the table
5. Show: tba
6. Filter: tba

## Technology
The project will be developed using the CPSC department's Oracle database system, Java, and JDBC. We will be using Java Swing for the GUI.
